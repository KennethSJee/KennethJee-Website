        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am currently a student studying mechanical engineering at the University of California, Riverside. As of now, I do not work during the school year, however, I have a seasonal job at CGV Cinemas Los Angeles. I began working at CGV Cinemas July of 2017 and have worked there whenever I was not at school. At CGV Cinemas, I work mainly as a concession stand cashier where I am in charge of helping customers purchase food and beverages to enjoy during their show. I also sell tickets and keep the theatre clean throughout my shift. Over the summer of 2019 I also worked at a pizza shop called Hello Pizza in La Crescenta. There I was mainly in charge of helping dine-in customers and going out on delivery orders. I have also been a volunteer with the American Red Cross since 2013. Starting in 2017, I have spent my summers volunteering at a summer camp ran by the American Red Cross called Leadership Development Camp. Leadership Development Camp, LDC for short, is a week long camp for high school students in which they are taught important leadership skills. Summer of 2017 and 2018, I was a staff member and I was in charge of helping organize certain events and making sure the camp ran smoothly. Summer of 2019, I was the Delegate Coordinator of the camp. My responsibilities were to help organize the list of high school students attending the camp that year and make sure that all the information that was needed by the American Red Cross was received and organized.<br><br>
